Our team successfully designed and developed a comprehensive smart pharmacy system for Sakr Pharmacy in Sheikh Zayed. The project combined both software and embedded system components, seamlessly integrated to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer experience, and enable real-time inventory tracking and order management.

Web Development
We built a fully functional online website and admin portal following best practices in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This ensured clean code structure, modularity, and scalability.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Backend: PHP (OOP with MVC), MySQL, phpMyAdmin

Features:

User-friendly customer website for browsing products, placing orders, and tracking deliveries

Secure admin portal with full control over:

Product management

User accounts and permissions

Orders and inventory

Real-time system notifications

Embedded Sensor System
To complement the web platform, we developed a sensor-based embedded system to automate inventory monitoring.

Technical Stack:

Hardware: Arduino microcontroller

Programming Language: C++

Communication: Telegram API

This system detects when any medicine is removed from the shelf and immediately sends a real-time notification to the pharmacist via a custom-built Telegram bot, keeping the inventory status always up to date.

Live Order Tracking
We also implemented a live order tracking system to enhance transparency and customer trust. Once a customer places an order, they can monitor its delivery progress in real time through the website.
